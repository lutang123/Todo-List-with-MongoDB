  <!-- when we use Express, it doesn't automatically serve up all the files in our project, in fact, it only serves up the main access point which we define in our package.json as app.j, and the views folder, everything else it chooses to ignore. Because we no longer operating a static website, all the files if we want to use them, we need to put them in public folder, this can include images etc. and then in app.js, we need to tell Express to serve up the public folder  -->
